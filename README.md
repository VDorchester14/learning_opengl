# Setting up C++ and OpenGL

This is a project where I'm going to learn how to set up OpenGL with C++. Hopefully this will serve as a future reference for me and anyone who is interested in learning to do this.

## Installing Visual Studio

For this project, I decided to use VisualStudio 2019 with the community license, largely because of its convenience and building utilities.
You can find the download link [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/).

- Go to the link and download visual studio community 2019.
- Start the install (I just followed the install instructions with default settings).
- Restart computer
